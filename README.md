Hand Tracking is a computer vision technique that detects and tracks hand movements in real time using a webcam or video input.
Google's MediaPipe provides a highly efficient Hand Tracking module that can detect 21 key landmarks of a hand,
making it ideal for gesture recognition, sign language detection, and interactive applications.
